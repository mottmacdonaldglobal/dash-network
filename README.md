# (Dash D3 Webcola) Orthogonal Network Graph

'Special' implementation of graph/network with gridlike layout and links.

Based initially on ['dash-network'] (https://github.com/plotly/dash-network) and ['dash-sunburst'](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sunburst) examples which show how to make D3 a 'slave' to React and how use  the [`dash-component-boilerplate` template](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate). 


This implementation used [Webcola](https://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/) for layout of notes and link routing, replacing 'D3 force' in ['dash-network'] (https://github..
com/plotly/dash-network)

Refer [original readme file](README_Original.md) for more info. 


## To demo and dev the component (without having to build use Python and Dash)

Demo in ['src/demo/']('src/demo') can be run with **node.js** :

```
npm install
npm run start
```

All being well you should be able to go to ['http://localhost:8080/']('http://localhost:8080/') to view
